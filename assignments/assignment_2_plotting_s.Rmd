You will have to create 3 plots based on the datasets and instructions detailed below. You will find the plots themeselves in the `assignments/assignment_2_plots`. Your task is to write the code that will reproduce the plots as closely as possible.

# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr), and working with factors (forcats)
-   Data visuzlization (ggplot2)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(scales)
`````````

## Task 1: Climbing expeditions

The 2020-09-22 TidyTueday datasets are about climbing expeditions. From the three datasets, use the "expeditions". Reproduce the plot below! Notice a few things:

-   Use `forcats::fct_lump()` to get the 15 most frequent peaks, and drop the "Other" category.
-   The bars are ordered by the sum of all expeditions (use `fct_reorder()`).
-   The bar colors use the viridis palette and light theme.

```{r}
climb <- tt_load("2020-09-22", files = "expeditions.csv")
climb <- climb$expeditions

climb2 <- climb |>  
  mutate(top_15 = fct_lump(peak_name, n=15, other_level = "Other")) |>
  filter(top_15 !="Other") |>
  count(top_15, season)
  

task1 <- ggplot(climb2, mapping = aes(x=fct_reorder(top_15,n, sum), y= n, fill = season)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  scale_fill_viridis_d()+
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs( title="The 15 most popular peaks stacked by season of expedition", y="Number of expeditions", x=NULL)

task1

```

## Task 2: PhDs awarded

The 2019-02-19 TidyTueday dataset is about phd-s awarded by year and field. There is only one dataset, it is called `phd_by_field`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all phd-s by broad fields.
-   To make the x axis breaks pretty, use `scales::pretty_breaks()`, to make the y axis labels comma formatted, use `scales::comma_format()`.
-   The line size is 1.2, the colors are from the brewer "Dark2" palette. The theme is set to minimal.

```{r}
phd <- tt_load("2019-02-19", files = "phd_by_field.csv")
phd <- phd$phd_by_field

phd <- phd |> filter(!is.na(n_phds))

phd2 <- aggregate(phd$n_phds, by=list(phd$broad_field, phd$year), FUN = "sum")

task2 <- ggplot(phd2, aes(x=Group.2, y=x, group = Group.1, color= Group.1))+
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks(n=4)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format()) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(title = "Nr of awarded PhDs in the US by year", x=NULL, y=NULL)

task2
```

## Task 3: Commute in the US

The 2019-11-05 TidyTueday dataset is about commuting to work in each city in the US by bike or on foot. There is only one dataset, it is called `commute`. Reproduce the plot below!

Notes:

-   First you have to aggregate the data to count all commutes by state.
-   Both axis scales are log transformed and the labels comma formatted, using `scales::comma_format()`
-   The point size is 2, . The theme is set to light.

```{r}
comm <- tt_load("2019-11-05", files = "commute.csv")
comm <- comm$commute

comm <- comm |> filter(!is.na(n))

comm2 <- aggregate(comm$n, by=list(comm$state_region, comm$state, comm$state_abb, comm$mode), FUN = "sum")|>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Group.4, values_from = x)

task3 <- ggplot(comm2, mapping =aes(x=Bike, y=Walk, group = Group.1, color=Group.1)) +
  geom_point(size =2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = state.abb), colour ="black")+
  scale_y_log10(labels=comma_format())+
  scale_x_log10(labels=comma_format())+
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position = "right")+
  labs(title = "Nr of people walking vs. biking to work in each US state",
       x="Nr of people biking to work (logN)",
       y="Nr of people walking to work (logN)",
       color= "State region")

task3  

```
